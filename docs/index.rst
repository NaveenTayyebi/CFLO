COMF Introduction
=============================================

COMF is an open source mini-package designed to provide tools to visualize compressible flow phenomena for students taking a first-course in compressible fluid dynamics. A reference for the fluid dynamics relations can be found in "Modern Compressible Flow" by Anderson (4th Ed, ISBN 978-1-260-57082-3). All of the classes are written in MATLAB.
